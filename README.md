# MovieAppReact using react + redux


# What do I do ?

With me, you can add movies in the list (so you will not forget the movies you 've loved' anymore ), you can edit and delete them.


# How to use:

Client : npm i && npm start

Server: npm i && npm run server


# Next ?

- Improve error handling
- Use real DB instead of local host
